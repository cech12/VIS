# VIS (Versatile Image Speech)

VIS (Versatile Image Speech) is a Java tool, which uses OCR (optical character recognition) and TTS (text-to-speech) services to enable images to be read aloud.

With the push of a button, a voice output can be played from an image on the clipboard.

- Plays back the converted speech
- (optional) Translates the detected text into the voices language before the speech is generated and played

### Translation Services
- Google Cloud Translation API - https://cloud.google.com/translate

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) (17 or higher recommended)
- Internet connection for utilizing OCR and TTS services
